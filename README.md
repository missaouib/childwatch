# Childwatch 2 Overall README

## Running in development

### Client

Prerequisite: Node installation.

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Server

See server/README.md.

Once the server is running, go to http://localhost:8080. It will serve files built by Angular CLI
without the need to restart either process. However, changes in server code are likely to require
restart of the server process to take effect.
